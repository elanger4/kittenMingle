									<h2>Name: Emily</h2>
									<h2>Email: myarnival@meowspace.com</h2>
									<h2>Breed: Chinese Hairless</h2>
									<h2>Number of Lives Left: 6</h2>
									<h2>Description</h2>
									<p>A cat doesnt look this good just by will power. Im a constant groomer,  This makes me smell good and look shiny and soft. And, I love to do it. After all, a cat does love to look as beautiful and glamorous as possible. You know, just in case an impromptu catwalk appears. I also greatly enjoy purring. The sound of a dogs bark, what a bunch of hubub. Id absolutely love a big, strong cat who knows how to make me purr. Lets just say I really want to connect and fall in love with someone wholl know how to pounce on me. ;)</p>

									<h2>Name: Alex</h2>
									<h2>Email: purr@fection.me</h2>
									<h2>Breed: PeterBald</h2>
									<h2>Number of Lives Left: 1/2</h2>
									<h2>Description</h2>
									<p>As you can see, Im a bit of an older fellow. Only having half life means im probably going to expire soon. That being said, Im really big into naps  As im sure you can assume, with just the right amount of human interaction, im able to get through my day without taking that inevitable jump off the scratching post. Im prettty much the worst person ever. I hate Queen, Rush, 808 drums and pretty much music in general. I am currently unemployed and live with my parents. hmu yo ;)</p>

									<h2>Name: Chris</h2>
									<h2>Email: meow@fluffy.me</h2>
									<h2>Breed: Himalayan</h2>
									<h2>Number of Lives Left: 4</h2>
									<h2>Description</h2>
									<p>First and foremost, i’m a stalker.  Lol but not in the creepy way, as in like i’m a hunter.  Im the kind of cat who wants to take charge in a situation. I enjoy being the best at what I do and providing for those who I care about. I would rather be a rock star then a movie star. My personal theory on music, is that it is just pure, emotional communication, have you ever listened to a song in another language but still understood on an emotional level, what the song was trying to express? Music can bring emotions out in us and bring us back to emotions that we felt in the past… it’s a talent that I wish I had, and emotions are really the most addictive chemicals. Thats pretty much me :)</p>

									<h2>Name: Werenika</h2>
									<h2>Email: meow@fluffy.meS</h2>
									<h2>Breed: Siamese</h2>
									<h2>Number of Lives Left: 8</h2>
									<h2>Description</h2>
									<p>Hi, I’m Wereniqqa. Sorry if my English isn’t so great, I’m not from this country:/ I never quite know how to start these things, so I think I’ll just list a bunch of things that I enjoy: Travel, surprises, music, dancing, sports, books, last minute plans, open mind, photography, museum, craziness, spontaneity, going out (but also staying in), sharing, simplicity, respect, flip flops (yes, the sandals), down to earth (however fantasy is also very important), people, casual, word, news, work, sense of humor about yourself, awareness.
									I’ve been really big into yarn and meowmix recently, but at my core I really just like having fun

									<h2>Name: Rosie</h2>
									<h2>Email: feistyfeast@lit_box.net</h2>
									<h2>Breed: Exotic Shorthair</h2>
									<h2>Number of Lives Left: 5</h2>
									<h2>Description</h2>
									<p>Hey, Im Rosie. My friends describe me as: feisty, warm, generous, thoughtful and caring. The one thing I wish people would notice more about me is that I can be forthright and direct when I need to be. Not in a bar-fight kind of way... but I do know how to get what I want. What I think I am looking for now is love, intimacy, and getting swept up in a new relationship; that whirlwind when you meet someone and fall for them instantly. I think true romance is about getting to know someone and connecting on a deep level; its more than just chemistry and attraction.
